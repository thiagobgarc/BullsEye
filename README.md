# Bullseye

## This is one of the first projects created with iOS' Swift programming language.
  It is one of my initial projects in Swift. The objective of the game is for the user to locate and select the exact number displayed by the application. If the user successfully finds the correct number, they are awarded points. To enhance the user experience, additional features have been implemented, including a navigation button for ease of use. The application also allows the user to keep track of their progress by displaying the number of rounds played and the score accumulated. In an update, a functional restart button has been added to the game, enabling the user to start a new round. The game's score tracking and round counting mechanisms are fully operational.
